## ðŸŽ¨ Next Steps

I still need to update the content sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact) with the new color scheme. Would you like me to continue updating those sections to match the new artistic grey/white theme with black accents?

The sections that still need color updates:
1. About Portal - needs grey cards instead of purple
2. Experience Timeline - needs black/grey theme  
3. Projects Galaxy - needs light cards with black accents
4. Skills Matrix - needs grey progress bars
5. Contact Dimension - needs light form styling

Should I proceed with updating all these sections?
