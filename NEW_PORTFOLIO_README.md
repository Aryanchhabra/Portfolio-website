- Setting up contact info
- Connecting social media
- Integrating form backend

## 🎯 Current State

The portfolio is **fully functional** with placeholder content. The dev server should be running at:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🌟 Unique Features That Make This Stand Out

1. **3D Background**: Not just decorative—it's interactive and responds to scrolling
2. **Custom Cursor**: Professional touch that most portfolios lack
3. **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Every section comes alive as you scroll
4. **Glassmorphism**: Modern, premium aesthetic

## 🎨 Creative Elements

- Portal/dimensional travel theme
- Cosmic/space aesthetic
- Neon cyberpunk accents
- Floating geometric shapes
- Morphing distortion effects
- Particle systems
- Gradient overlays
- Pulsing animations

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

- Touch-friendly navigation
- Responsive grid layouts
- Optimized 3D particle count
- Standard cursor on mobile
- Hamburger menu
- Stacked sections

## 🔧 Build & Deploy

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Deploy the `dist` folder to:
- Vercel (recommended)
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Any static host

## 💡 Tips for Customization

1. **Colors**: Search for gradient classes like `from-purple-500` and replace
2. **Emojis**: Change icons throughout to match your personality
3. **Animations**: Adjust `delay` and `duration` values in Framer Motion
4. **3D Effects**: Modify particle count in `Scene3D.jsx` for performance
5. **Sections**: Add/remove sections easily—they're all independent components

## 🎭 What Makes This "Out of the Box"

- **Not a typical portfolio**: This is an experience, not just a website
- **3D is integrated**, not just a background
- **Every interaction is delightful**: Hover effects, cursor changes, smooth transitions
- **Tells a story**: Journey through dimensions metaphor
- **Professional yet creative**: Balance of polish and personality
- **Technically impressive**: Shows off your skills through the site itself

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Open the dev server (should be at localhost:5173)
2. Review the design and flow
3. Use the personalization guide to add your content
4. Share your feedback for any adjustments
5. Deploy when ready!
